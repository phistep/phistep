### Hi there!
I'm Philipp—a physics graduate with a strong interest in software devolpment.
I also enjoy theater and acting, as well as cooking and cocktails.
Check [philippstephan.de](https://philippstephan.de) for more.

❗ I am currently looking for a technical software job in Berlin! If that sounds interesting to you, contact me here, on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-stephan/), or via [email](mailto:job@philippstephan.de).

For [Master's thesis](https://vamp.philippstephan.de) I worked on improving a numerical integration algortithm, and implemented in Python.
The field of numerical computation continues to interest me, and I would like to get more into it.
While I enjoy Python very much, I am working an toy projects to hone my C++ skills again.
